## Yacht Game
I coded a game commonly known as ‘Yacht Dice’ as a console version.
This game only works in Windows. (this program includes windows.h)
(Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to control console as like console size, cursor, etc. in other environments.)

This game still have a few issues. 
Please contact me if you find some issues.
(**DON'T CLICK KEYBOARD DURING DICE ROLL**)
